# Process Injection // NTDLL

## Useful Links

[WinAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list)

## Mini-projects

- ntdllinjection.c

#### [ntdllinjection.c](./ntdllinjection.c)

This is the same as dllinjection.c, however we implement the NTAPI version of WinAPI's CreateRemoteThread() call. NTAPI is lower-level.
The lower level we are the better chances we have of going undetected.

## Notes

Common API Calls:
